    <p>
        This project provided valuable insights into the practical application of
        graph algorithms and their role in solving real-world problems. By designing
        an intelligent drone delivery routing system, we were able to bridge the gap
        between theoretical concepts and system-level implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gained a deeper understanding of classical graph algorithms such as
            Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford, Prim, and Kruskal, including their strengths
            and limitations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Learned how algorithm performance varies significantly based on graph
            size, density, and spatial distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed skills in modeling real-world logistics problems as weighted
            graphs and analyzing algorithm suitability.
        </li>
        <li>
            Acquired experience in designing explainable AI systems that justify
            decision-making rather than acting as black boxes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improved proficiency in full-stack development by integrating algorithms,
            visualization, and user interaction.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Algorithm Selection</h2>
    <p>
        One of the most significant insights gained from this project is the critical
        importance of selecting the appropriate algorithm for a given problem
        scenario. While multiple algorithms may produce correct results, their
        efficiency, scalability, and reliability can differ substantially.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, lightweight traversal algorithms such as BFS may perform well
        for small or unweighted networks but fail to guarantee optimality in weighted
        graphs. Conversely, algorithms like Dijkstra provide guaranteed shortest paths
        but may become computationally expensive in large or dense networks.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project highlights that no single algorithm is universally optimal.
        Intelligent systems must evaluate contextual factors and adapt their strategy
        accordingly. The AI-based algorithm selection mechanism implemented in this
        project demonstrates how informed decision-making can significantly improve
        system performance.
    </p>

    <h2>General Project Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Successfully designed a modular and scalable drone delivery routing system.
        </li>
        <li>
            Implemented a comparative framework for evaluating multiple algorithms
            under varying conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhanced system transparency through visual simulations and explainable
            recommendations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a user-friendly interface that clearly communicates technical
            insights.
        </li>
        <li>
            Established a strong foundation for future enhancements such as
            multi-drone coordination and real-time constraints.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Overall, this project reinforced the importance of thoughtful algorithm
        selection, system adaptability, and explainability in the development of
        intelligent autonomous systems.
