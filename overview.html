    <h1>Project Overview</h1>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The rapid growth of e-commerce and same-day delivery services has created
        a strong demand for faster, more efficient, and environmentally friendly
        logistics solutions. Traditional ground-based delivery systems are often
        limited by traffic congestion, fuel costs, and infrastructure constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
        Autonomous drone delivery systems provide a promising alternative, but
        introduce complex challenges related to route planning and decision-making.
        A drone delivery network may contain multiple delivery locations with
        varying distances and spatial distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Choosing a single routing algorithm for all scenarios is inefficient,
        as different algorithms perform optimally under different network
        conditions. Small networks benefit from lightweight traversal algorithms,
        while larger or denser networks require more advanced shortest-path
        techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, many routing systems lack explainability, making it difficult
        to justify why a particular algorithm was selected. This reduces trust and
        adaptability in autonomous systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary challenge addressed by this project is to design an adaptive,
        intelligent, and explainable routing system capable of dynamically selecting
        the most suitable algorithm for drone delivery operations.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
        This project introduces an AI-driven drone delivery system that models
        delivery locations as a weighted graph. The system evaluates multiple graph
        algorithms simultaneously and assigns each a competitive score based on
        network characteristics such as size, density, and spatial spread.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of relying on a fixed algorithm, the system dynamically selects
        the most appropriate routing strategy. The selected route is visualized
        on an interactive map, and a drone animation simulates real-world delivery.
    </p>
